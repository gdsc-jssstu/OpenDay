        "Started as an offshoot of Civil Engineering, a humble beginning was made in 1987 as Centre for Environmental Science and Technology (CEST) to promote and start a new programme in Environmental Engineering catering to the needs of the developing society. B.E. (Civil and Environmental Engineering) and M.Tech., (Environmental Engineering) with the financial support from CPHEEO, Ministry of Urban Development, Govt. of India, New Delhi were started under the umbrella of CEST. In the year 1993, the Govt. of Karnataka has accorded grant-in-aid status to the department and since then the Department of Environmental Engineering is working as a full-fledged academic and research department.",
